# Setup a Clustered Environment to Run the Universal Recommender

 - [Setup, installing services on 1 standalone machine](https://github.com/actionml/cluster-setup/blob/master/single-driver-machine.md) Not recommended except for very small datasets on a development machine or as a first step towards a distributed Spark setup.
 - [Setup, installing services on 3 clustered machines](https://github.com/actionml/cluster-setup/blob/master/minimum-cluster-setup.md) Good for a dev/experimental setup with small-ish datasets.
 - [Setup for a fully disbributed cluster](https://github.com/actionml/cluster-setup/blob/master/distributed-cluster-setup-guide.md) The ultimate in scalability with all services split out in their own clusters for independent scaling and maintenance. For very high load and large datasets or for multi-tenancy.
